					| Great things happen at the intersection of technology and creativity,
					| and that is where I like to center my thinking. I strive for a deep
					| understanding of both computers and people. During my undergraduate
					| career, I have taken classes in computer science, psychology, marketing,
					| and the arts. I have made a great effort to develop whole-brain thinking,
					| and I would like to put this unique mindset to work for you.

					| While I am a well rounded person, development is my core. Since the start
					| of my programming career, I have contributed to numerous projects in over ten
					| languages. To complete these projects, I have produced polished front-end
					| as well as high-performance back-end code. Whatever kind of programmer
					| you need on a particular day, I can deliver.

				p
					| When creating software, the user always comes first. I take great pride
					| in being a developer who understands people as well as computers. I aim to
					| delight individuals with my work, and I have taken classes in psychology and
					| design to help me achieve this goal. When your product needs to be beautiful
					| in both form and function, I am prepared to help make it shine.

				p
					| It is imperative to have team members who understand business in addition to

					| about the products I contribute to. My business classes, internship involvement,
					| and experience forming a startup have equipped me to handle the entire breadth
					| of challenges that you might face when managing a product.

							| Roommates split rent, bills, groceries, and more. Splitting
							| costs is necessary for some expenses and convenient for others. There are, however,
							| problems. Dividing expenses evenly is confusing and time consuming. Obtaining checks
							| and cash to pay back roommates is inconvenient. Exchanging money is awkward. People
							| lose track of who owes who. Divit solves these problems by allowing roommates
							| to quickly enter expenses as they come in. At the end of each month, all roommates
							| are payed back through Venmo. With Divit, roommates can spend less time swapping money and more time swapping stories.
