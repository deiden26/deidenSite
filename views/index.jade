				p
					| I am Danny Eiden, a developer with an interdisciplinary mind. My goal is
					| to combine a deep understanding of computers, people, and businesses to
					| create novel products. Throughout my undergraduate career, I have taken classes
					| in computer science, marketing, psychology, and the design. Outside of class,
					| I have worked as a developer,  a product manager, and founder of a start-up.
					| These experiences have given me the tools for whole-brain thinking, and I
					| would like to put this unique mindset to work for you.

				p
					| While I am a well rounded person, development is my core. Since the start
					| of my programming career, I have contributed to numerous projects in over ten
					| languages. To complete these projects, I have produced polished front-end
					| as well as high-performance back-end code. Whatever kind of programmer
					| you need, I can deliver.

				h4(class="design") UX & Design
				p
					| When creating software, the user always comes first. I take great pride
					| in being a developer who understands people as well as computers. I aim to
					| delight individuals with my work, and I have taken classes in psychology and
					| user experience to help me achieve this goal. When your product needs to be beautiful
					| in both form and function, I am prepared to make it shine.

				h4(class="product-management") Product Management
				p
					| It is imperative to have team members who understand business in addition to
					| technology. From competitive landscape to LTV:CAC, I like to know everything
					| about the products I contribute to. My business classes, internships,
					| and experience forming a startup have equipped me to handle the entire breadth
					| of challenges that you face when managing a product.

							| can spend less time swapping money and more time swapping stories.
